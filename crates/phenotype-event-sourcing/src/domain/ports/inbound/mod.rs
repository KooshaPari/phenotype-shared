//! # Inbound Ports (Primary/Driving Ports)
//!
//! These ports define the **use cases** that the application exposes.
//! Inbound adapters (API, CLI) call these ports to trigger business logic.
//!
//! ## Example Use Cases
//!
//! - `AppendEventPort` - Append a new event to an aggregate
//! - `GetEventsPort` - Retrieve events for an aggregate
//! - `VerifyChainPort` - Verify hash chain integrity
